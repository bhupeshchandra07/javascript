// to declare the variable in tha js we use the following rules and keywords in the js.
const pi = 3.14 // can not be chagne if one defined

let userName = "Bhupesh"//can be change when we need

var userEmail = "bhupesh@gmail.com"//also can be change when we need

age = 21//this is a also a way to define the variable but this is not a good pratice so dont use.

let city;//this is also a way. but untill not get value it is undefined.

//note: we won't be use the 'var' further in our coding journy because the var is not block scoped and the let
// is the block scoped. so we use the two way to decalre our variable in js. 'const' and 'let'

console.log(pi); // we can print one by one or a another method is given below.

// this is the tabluer method to print the variables.
console.log([pi,userName,userEmail,age,city]);
